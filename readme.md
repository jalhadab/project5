## Team Members (Project 5)
- Jaafar Al Hadab (Visual Designer)
- Michael Bashner (Technician)
- Qi Miao (IA)

## Visual Design
Tried to keep with the techy, smart, navy-beige themes of the previous design. Mainly focuesd on increasing usability and designing an intuitive interface.

## Technician
Wireframe organizes users alphabetically. The website organizes students chronologically from when their entry was created.

## IA
- Create wireframes and htmls
- Choreography: On the index page, following the z-pattern, users can login at the top right corner and everyone can directly go to see the student records by clicking "Go to Directory". On the student directory page, student records shown are sorted by an alpabetic order from top to the bottom.(Not technically for real, but it's the choreography for wireframe.) This page follows the F-pattern. By signing up on the hidden website register.php, users can edit or add new student records. After logged in, "Add a New Student Record" button can be easily seen on the top-right part when users start browsing the directory.(Not at the bottom like the wireframe, but this change makes sense for users logged in.) Functions about personal account are all on the top and in the header part.

## Choreography
Overall, our pages are organized by alphabet order and general-to-specific order (a kind of hierarchy).

We have 5 pages including the home page, the directory, Bo's page, Emely's page, and Kim's Page. Following the general to specific order, we decide to put home page on the left most in the navigation bar. Then the directory and then the student specific pages are a dropdown from the directory button. Then Bo, Emely, Kim are arranged in alphabetic order.  

Within the home(index) page, the z-pattern uses a navy to blue linear background gradient that follows the reading gravity from the top left to the bottom right to help guide the user's vision.

Within each personal page, we decide to use general-to-specific order from top to bottom. There are 4 sections - overview, early years, major course list, hobby. Overview is summary of the page so it is the most general section. Early years is the summary of our past 20 years so it is the second most general section. Major courses and Hobby are really specific sections. Hobby is the most specific one because everyone has a special leisure activity and reasons behind it. By the way, to some degree, the past experience also influence which major and hobby we choose today. It is also a kind of time order.
