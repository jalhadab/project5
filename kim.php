						<h2>Early Years</h2>
						<p> I was born in Daegu, South Korea and moved to Ulsan. After living in Ulsan for 7 years, my parents decided to move to Busan for better education. I went elementary school and middle school in Busan then I told my parents that I want to study in the United States. In 2012, I left South Korea and started to study in Rhode Island. I met most of my good friends during that time.</p>

						<h2>Hobby</h2>
							<p>In United States, I usually watch movie with my friends and cook. I love Science Fiction, action, and comic. I try to cook various kind including simple italian food, korean traditional dishes and typical brunch menu. In Korea, I mostly spend time with my dog, Abong (corgi). I usually walk him for at least one hour but he never gets enough of it. I also love trying new restaurants and adding good ones to my favorite restaurant list.</p>
