					<h2 class="first-heading">Early Years</h2>
					<p>My name is Emely Rosa-Ortiz. I am a rising senior student in University of Rochester majoring in computer science. I am from New York City. I am Dominican and Puerto Rican because my mom is from PR and my dad is from DR. I grew up in Brooklyn, NY. However, I did spend a year of my life in the Dominican Republic where I was home schooled. I went to elementary school, middle school, and high school all in Brooklyn. I graduated from Uncommon Charter High School in 2017 with High Honors. Now I am going into hopefully my last year at the UR.</p>

					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					<p> I don't get to do my "hobbies" that often. However, I am into latte art. I started liking latte art last summer when I worked at Ralph's Coffee Shop. At first it's pretty tricky, but you get the hang of it. I am not that great. I am also into playing Animal Crossing.</p>
