					<h2 class="first-heading">Early Years</h2>
					<p>I was born in Huoshan - a county with a reservoir and a winery. I grow up at bottom of the reservoir. Later, I was sent to a boarding school at Hefei - the captical city in the province. I took my middle school and high school there. After finishing second year of the high school, for some reasons, I quit the school. Then I come to the Unites States. I took 1-year language program at UIS, and 2-year college life in SLU. Finally, I transferred to UR in Spring 2020.</p>

					<h2>Hobby</h2>
					<p>In my spare time, gaming is the main entertainment activity. I love these dedicate video games. I had been addicted to it for a long period since the first time I played it during primary school. As I grow up, I start to become more self-discipline and play more and more games. It does help me have my own judgement about what kind of games is fun and good for me. Because of this hobby, I take computer science major in hope of becoming a video game developer in the future. Besides video games, I also pay attention to electronic product including phones, video cards and game consoles. I think the most notable product in 2020 is Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X, which mark the beginning of 4K age.</p>
